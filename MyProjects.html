Formula 1 is a data-driven sport, with large amounts of data being gathered and analysed to give competitors the edge over one another to achieve the
goal of winning World Championships. This project will explore graph databases and visualisation techniques to model the dataset in Neo4j, and explore the
visualisations provided to analyse the dataset and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using graph databases for analysis of the dataset.

    Edinburgh Airport Flight Information for August 2017
</a>

<br>
Using some <a href="files/EdinburghAirportFllghtInformation-RawData.xlsx">raw data</a> containing information about flights which arrived or departed from
Edinburgh Airport, I created a report analysing this data to produce a monthly summary of passenger flight information illustrating trends on passenger distributions,
aircraft delays, seat load factors, pier service levels, and passenger distributions across departure gates and baggage reclaim belts. This data analysis has been
carried out using Microsoft Excel, with the report being produced with Microsoft Word. Furthermore, I have created a visualisation of this raw data in PowerBI 
to provide another method of representing this data.

If you have any other data analysis which I could carry out, or you want to give me feedback on any of my work, then please contact me and I would love to discuss!

I am currently in the process of creating comprehensive notes for all SQA subjects at National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher level. The plan is for all subjects
to be included eventually, both those I have completed myself as well as the subjects I have not yet achieved, as I love learning new things! Each subject will contain 
comprehensive course notes and past paper questions. 

<br><br>

I want learning and study resources to be available to as many people as possible, which is why they are free for anyone to use. However, any contributions to my hosting fees are
much appreciated. All donations are spent on creating more study resources and ensuring as many people as possible can benefit.
